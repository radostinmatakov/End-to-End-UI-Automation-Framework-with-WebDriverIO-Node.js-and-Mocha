# End-to-End UI Automation Framework with WebDriverIO, Node.js, and Mocha

## Project Overview

This project is a non-executable framework, that I have built from scratch, designed to showcase the structure and principles of a robust UI testing framework. The focus is on demonstrating key software engineering concepts such as Page Object Model (POM), inheritance, data handling, and encapsulation in the context of test automation.

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a template for learning and understanding the architecture of a scalable and maintainable UI testing framework. It includes examples of:

### 1. Page Object Model (POM): Simplifying and organizing code by separating page-specific actions and elements into individual classes.

### 2. Inheritance: Utilizing base classes for shared methods and properties across different components.

### 3. Data Handling: Managing test data efficiently for parameterized tests or dynamic inputs.

### 4. Encapsulation: Ensuring modularity and protecting the framework components from unintended access or modification.

## Key Features

### 1. Built from Scratch: Every component in this project was designed and implemented without relying on pre-existing templates.

### 2. Well-structured folder hierarchy for organizing framework components.

### 3. Examples of class relationships to demonstrate object-oriented programming principles.

### 4. Placeholder code snippets for key functionalities, such as:

- Page classes representing different parts of a UI.

- Test classes showcasing inheritance and interaction with POM elements.

- Utility classes for common operations (e.g., data handling or logging).

### 5. OOP Principles: Demonstrating inheritance and encapsulation to enhance framework scalability.

## Limitations

This project is not executable and does not include real data, configurations, or runtime scripts. Its sole purpose is to serve as an educational resource for understanding the framework's architecture that

## How to Use

### 1. Explore the code: Review the folder structure and class relationships to understand the framework design.

### 2. Learn concepts: Identify how POM, inheritance, data handling, and encapsulation are applied.

### 3. Extend for practice: You can build upon this structure to create your own executable test automation project.
